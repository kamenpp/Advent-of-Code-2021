# Advent-of-Code-2021
My first ever coding challenge

I decided to participate because I love problem-solving and because I need to practice more. I am very new to coding still, but I want to do this in future and have a great desire to learn, so I thought that the best way to learn is by practice.

I will be attempting to get all stars, but bearing in mind my coding skills, this might not be possible this time around. Anyway, I will give what I am capable of, and will try to set aside about an hour a day for this coding competition.
