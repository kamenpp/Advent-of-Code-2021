# Advent-of-Code-2021

I decided to participate because I love problem-solving and because I need to practice more. I am very new to coding still, but I want to do this in future and have a great desire to learn, so I thought that the best way to learn is by practice.

I will be attempting to get all stars, but bearing in mind my coding skills, this might not be possible this time around. Anyway, I will give what I am capable of, and will try to set aside a fair amount of my free time for this coding competition.

I will also post my progress on this file:

Days 1, 2, 3 were relatively easy, and without too much trouble or help I was able to find a solution (which is far from being optimal but I am happy to have done it by myself). These got me very excited.

Day 5 - got help (didn't know how to use a dictionary with tuples as keys, part 1 only).

Day 6 - I liked it.

Day 7 - didn't even need to determine the exact horizontal value to get the fuel.

Day 8 - not too hard to create the algorithm but a bit fiddly to implement. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it.

Day 9 - I learnt what bfs is and how it is supposed to be implemented.

Day 10, 11 - not too hard after day 9.

Day 14 - the approach that one has to take for part 2 is quite clever.
